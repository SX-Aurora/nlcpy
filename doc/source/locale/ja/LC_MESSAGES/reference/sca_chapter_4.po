"The SCA interface supports up to 4 dimension :class:`nlcpy.ndarray`. It "
"can handle stencil computations of arbitrary shape (axial, planar, "
"diagonal, and its combination)."

"In terms of dtype (data type), the current version of the SCA interface "
"supports only ``float32`` and ``float64``."

"As for integer types (int, uint, etc.), convert dtype into ``float32`` or"
" ``float64``."

":func:`nlcpy.sca.create_kernel` dynamically generates a instruction "
"sequence required to perform stencil computations on VE. This generating "
"cost is not small compared to :func:`nlcpy.sca.kernel.kernel.execute`, so"
" the overall performance gets better as the number of kernel executions "
"per kernel generation increase."

msgid ""
"An output :class:`nlcpy.ndarray` may not be shared with an input "
":class:`nlcpy.ndarray`. Otherwise, unpredictable results occurs."
