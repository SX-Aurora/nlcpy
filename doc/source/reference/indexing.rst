Indexing Routines
=================

The following tables show indexing routines provided by NLCPy.

Generating Index Arrays
-----------------------

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: generated/
    :nosignatures:

    nlcpy.diag_indices
    nlcpy.nonzero
    nlcpy.where

Indexing-like Operations
------------------------

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: generated/
    :nosignatures:

    nlcpy.diag
    nlcpy.diagonal
    nlcpy.select
    nlcpy.take

Inserting data into arrays
--------------------------

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: generated/
    :nosignatures:

    nlcpy.fill_diagonal
