Performance Enhancements
------------------------

* Improved performance of universal functions with multi-dimensional arrays.
* Improved performance of broadcasting operations from a scalar value to an :class:`ndarray`.
* Improved performance of :func:`arccos` and :func:`arctanh`.
* Improved performance of random number generators by changing the number of threads to be execeted on VE.

Problem Fixes
-------------

* Fixed a bug in :func:`sort` that might cause a freeze of Python interpreter at the end of the program.
* Fixed a bug in :func:`matmul` that returned invalid results when input ndarrays (a and b) fulfill any of the following conditions:

    + a.flags.c_congituous is False and a.flags.f_contiguous is False
    + b.flags.c_congituous is False and b.flags.f_contiguous is False

* Fixed a bug in :func:`prof.print_run_stats` that might showed negative elapsed time.
