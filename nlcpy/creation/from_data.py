def array(object, dtype=None, copy=True, order='K', subok=False, ndmin=0):
    """Creates an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    object : array_like
        An array, any object exposing the array interface, an object whose \\__array\\__
        method returns an array, or any (nested) sequence.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The desired dtype for the array. If not given, then the type will be determined
        as the minimum type required to hold the objects in the sequence. This argument
        can only be used to 'upcast' the array. For downcasting, use the .astype(t)
        method.
    copy : bool, optional
        If true (default), then the object is copied. Otherwise, a copy will only be made
        if \\__array\\__ returns a copy, if object is a nested sequence, or if a copy is
        needed to satisfy any of the other requirements (*dtype*, *order*, etc.).
    order : {'K', 'A', 'C', 'F'}, optional
        Specify the memory layout of the array. If object is not an array,
        the newly created array will be in C order (row major) unless 'F'
        is specified, in which case it will be in Fortran order (column major).
        If object is an array the following holds.

        .. csv-table::
            :header: "order", "no copy", "copy=True"
            :widths: 5, 7, 15

            "'K'", "unchanged", "| F & C order preserved,
            | otherwise most similar order"
            "'A'", "unchanged", "| F order if input is F
            | and not C, otherwise C order"
            "'C'", "C order", "C order"
            "'F'", "F order", "F order"

        When ``copy=False`` and a copy is made for other reasons, the result
        is the same as if ``copy=True``, with some exceptions for A, see the
        Notes section. The default order is 'K'.

    subok : bool, optional
        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise, the returned array
        will be forced to be a base-class array (default). subok=True is Not Implemented.
    ndmin : int, optional
        Specifies the minimum number of dimensions that the resulting array should have.
        Ones will be prepended to the shape as needed to meet this requirement.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        An array object satisfying the specified requirements.

    Restriction
    -----------
    * object[i].shape not equals to object[j].shape for some i,j :
      *NotImplementedError* occurs.

    See Also
    --------
    empty_like : Returns a new array with the same
        shape and type as a given array.
    ones_like : Returns an array of ones with
        the same shape and type as a given array.
    zeros_like : Returns an array of zeros
        with the same shape and type as a given array.
    full_like : Returns a full array
        with the same shape and type as a given array.
    empty : Returns a new array of given
        shape and type, without initializing entries.
    ones : Returns a new array of given
        shape and type, filled with ones.
    zeros : Returns a new array of given
        shape and type, filled with zeros.
    full : Returns a new array of given
        shape and type, filled with fill_value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import nlcpy as vp
    >>> vp.array([1, 2, 3])
    array([1, 2, 3])

    Upcasting:

    >>> vp.array([1, 2, 3.0])

    More than one dimension:

    >>> vp.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

def copy(a, order='K'):

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input data.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
        Controls the memory layout of the copy. 'C' means C-order, 'F' means F-order, 'A'
        means 'F' if *a* is Fortran contiguous, 'C' otherwise. 'K' means match the layout
        of *a* as closely as possible. (Note that this function and :func:`ndarray.copy`

    A highly efficient way of reading binary data with a known data-type, as well as
    parsing simply formatted text files. Data written using the *tofile* method can be
    read using this function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : file or str or pathlib.Path
        Open file object or filename.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Data type of the returned array. For binary files, it is used to determine
        the size and byte-order of the items in the file.
    count : int, optional
        Number of items to read. ``-1`` means all items (i.e., the complete file).
    sep : str, optional
        Separator between items if file is a text file. Empty ("") separator means
        the file should be treated as binary. Spaces (" ") in the separator match
        zero or more whitespace characters. A separator consisting only of spaces
        must match at least one whitespace.
    offset : int, optional
        The offset (in bytes) from the file's current position. Defaults to 0. Only
        permitted for binary files.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Data read from the file.

    Note
    ----
    Do not rely on the combination of *tofile* and :func:`fromfile` for data storage,
    as the binary files generated are not platform independent. In particular, no
    byte-order or data-type information is saved. Data can be stored in the platform
    independent ``.npy`` format using save and load instead.

    --------
    loadtxt : Loads data from a text file.
    load : Loads arrays or pickled objects from ``.npy``, ``.npz`` or pickled files.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> x = np.random.uniform(0, 1, 5)

    """Loads data from a text file.

    Each row in the text file must have the same number of values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : file or str or pathlib.Path
        File, filename, or generator to read. If the filename extension is ``.gz`` or
        ``.bz2``, the file is first decompressed. Note that generators should return
        byte strings for Python 3k.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Data-type of the resulting array; default: float.
    comments : str or sequence of str, optional
        The characters or list of characters used to indicate the start of a comment.
        None implies no comments. For backwards compatibility, byte strings will be
        decoded as 'latin1'. The default is '#'.
    delimiter : str, optional
        The string used to separate values. For backwards compatibility, byte strings
        will be decoded as 'latin1'. The default is whitespace.
    converters : dict, optional
        A dictionary mapping column number to a function that will parse the column
        string into the desired value. E.g., if column 0 is a date string:
        ``converters = {0: datestr2num}``. Converters can also be used to provide a
        default value for missing data:
        ``converters = {3: lambda s: float(s.strip() or 0)}``. Default: None.
    skiprows : int, optional
        Skip the first skiprows lines, including comments; default: 0.
    usecols : int or sequence, optional
        Which columns to read, with 0 being the first. For example, ``usecols = (1,4,5)``
        will extract the 2nd, 5th and 6th columns. The default, None, results in all
        columns being read.
    unpack : bool, optional
        If True, the returned array is transposed, so that arguments may be unpacked
        using ``x, y, z = loadtxt(...)``. Default is False.
    ndmin : int, optional
        The returned array will have at least *ndmin* dimensions. Otherwise
        mono-dimensional axes will be squeezed. Legal values: 0 (default), 1 or 2.
    encoding : str, optional
        Encoding used to decode the inputfile. Does not apply to input streams. The
        special value 'bytes' enables backward compatibility workarounds that ensures
        you receive byte arrays as results if possible and passes 'latin1' encoded
        strings to converters.
        Override this value to receive unicode arrays and pass strings as input to
        converters. If set to None the system default is used. The default value is
        'bytes'.
    max_rows : int, optional
        Read *max_rows* lines of content after *skiprows* lines.
        The default is to read all the lines.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Data read from the text file.

    Note
    ----
    This function aims to be a fast reader for simply formatted files.
    The strings produced by the Python float.hex method can be used as input for
    floats.

    --------
    load : Loads arrays or pickled objects from ``.npy``, ``.npz`` or pickled files.
