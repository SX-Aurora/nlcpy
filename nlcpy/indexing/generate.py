def where(condition, x=None, y=None):
    """Returns elements chosen from *x* or *y* depending on *condition*.

    Note
    ----
    When only condition is provided, this function is a shorthand for
    ``nlcpy.asarray(condition).nonzero()``. Using nonzero directly should be preferred,
    as it behaves correctly for subclasses. The rest of this documentation covers only
    the case where all three arguments are provided.

    Parameters
    ----------
    condition : array_like, bool
        Where True, yield *x*, otherwise yield *y*.
    x, y : array_like
        Values from which to choose. *x*, *y* and *condition* need to be broadcastable to
        some shape.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        An array with elements from *x* where *condition* is True, and elements from *y*
        elsewhere.

    Note
    ----
    If all the arrays are 1-D, :func:`where` is equivalent to::

        [xv if c else yv for c, xv, yv in zip(condition, x, y)]

    See Also
    --------
    nonzero : Returns the indices of the elements
        that are non-zero.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import nlcpy as vp
    >>> a = vp.arange(10)
    >>> a
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    >>> vp.where(a < 5, a, 10*a)
    array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90])

    This can be used on multidimensional arrays too:

    >>> vp.where([[True, False], [True, True]],
    ...          [[1, 2], [3, 4]],
    ...          [[9, 8], [7, 6]])
    array([[1, 8],
           [3, 4]])

    The shapes of x, y, and the condition are broadcast together:

    >>> x = vp.arange(3).reshape([3,1])
    >>> y = vp.arange(4).reshape([1,4])
    >>> vp.where(x < y, x, 10 + y)  # both x and 10+y are broadcast
    array([[10,  0,  0,  0],
           [10, 11,  1,  1],
           [10, 11, 12,  2]])
    >>> a = vp.array([[0, 1, 2],
    ...               [0, 2, 4],
    ...               [0, 3, 6]])
    >>> vp.where(a < 4, a, -1)  # -1 is broadcast
    array([[ 0,  1,  2],
           [ 0,  2, -1],
           [ 0,  3, -1]])

    """

        condition = False
