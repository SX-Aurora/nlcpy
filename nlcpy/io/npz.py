def load(file, mmap_mode=None, allow_pickle=False, fix_imports=True, encoding='ASCII'):
    """Loads arrays or pickled objects from ``.npy``, ``.npz`` or pickled files.

    .. Warning::
        Loading files that contain object arrays uses the ``pickle`` module, which is
        not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Consider passing
        ``allow_pickle=False`` to load data that is known not to contain object arrays
        for the safer handling of untrusted sources.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : file-like object, string, or pathlib.Path
        The file to read. File-like objects must support the ``seek()`` and ``read()``
        methods. Pickled files require that the file-like object support the
        ``readline()`` method as well.
    mmap_mode : {None, 'r+', 'r', 'w+', 'c'}, optional
        If not None, memory-map the file to construct an intermediate
        :obj:`numpy.ndarray` object and create :obj:`nlcpy.ndarray` from it.
    allow_pickle : bool, optional
        Allow loading pickled object arrays stored in npy files. Reasons for
        disallowing pickles include security, as loading pickled data can execute
        arbitrary code. If pickles are disallowed, loading object arrays will fail.
        Default: False
    fix_imports : bool, optional
        Only useful when loading Python 2 generated pickled files on Python 3, which
        includes npy/npz files containing object arrays. If *fix_imports* is True,
        pickle will try to map the old Python 2 names to the new names used in Python
        3.
    encoding : str, optional
        What encoding to use when reading Python 2 strings. Only useful when loading
        Python 2 generated pickled files in Python 3, which includes npy/npz files
        containing object arrays. Values other than 'latin1', 'ASCII', and 'bytes'
        are not allowed, as they can corrupt numerical data. Default: 'ASCII'

    Returns
    -------
    result : ndarray, tuple, dict, etc.
        Data stored in the file. For ``.npz`` files, the returned instance of NpzFile
        class must be closed to avoid leaking file descriptors.

    Note
    ----
    - If the file contains pickle data, then whatever object is stored in the pickle
      is returned.
    - If the file is a ``.npy`` file, then a single array is returned.
    - If the file is a ``.npz`` file, then a dictionary-like object is returned,
      containing {filename: array} key-value pairs, one for each file in the archive.
    - If the file is a ``.npz`` file, the returned value supports the context manager
      protocol in a similar fashion to the open function::

          with load('foo.npz') as data:
              a = data['a']

      The underlying file descriptor is closed when exiting the 'with' block.

    See Also
    --------
    loadtxt : Loads data from a text file.

    Examples
    --------
    Store data to disk, and load it again:

    >>> import nlcpy as vp
    >>> vp.save('/tmp/123', vp.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]))
    >>> vp.load('/tmp/123.npy')
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])

    Store compressed data to disk, and load it again:

    >>> a=vp.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> b=vp.array([1, 2])
    >>> vp.savez('/tmp/123.npz', a=a, b=b)
    >>> data = vp.load('/tmp/123.npz')
    >>> data['a']
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> data['b']
    array([1, 2])

def save(file, arr, allow_pickle=True, fix_imports=True):
    """Saves an array to a binary file in NumPy ``.npy`` format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : file, str, or pathlib.Path
        File or filename to which the data is saved. If file is a file-object,
        then the filename is unchanged. If file is a string or Path, a ``.npy``
        extension will be appended to the file name if it does not already have one.
    arr : array_like
        Array data to be saved.
    allow_pickle : bool, optional
        Allow saving object arrays using Python pickles. Reasons for disallowing pickles
        include security (loading pickled data can execute arbitrary code) and
        portability (pickled objects may not be loadable on different Python
        installations, for example if the stored objects require libraries that are not
        available, and not all pickled data is compatible between Python 2 and
        Python 3). Default: True
    fix_imports : bool, optional
        Only useful in forcing objects in object arrays on Python 3 to be pickled in a
        Python 2 compatible way. If fix_imports is True, pickle will try to map the new
        Python 3 names to the old module names used in Python 2, so that the pickle data
        stream is readable with Python 2.

    """Saves an array to a text file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : filename or file handle
        If the filename ends in ``.gz``, the file is automatically saved in compressed
        gzip format. loadtxt understands gzipped files transparently.
    x : 1D or 2D array_like

        'Iteration %d â€“ %10.5f', in which case *delimiter* is ignored.
        For complex *X*, the legal options for *fmt* are:

        - a single specifier, *fmt='%.4e'*, resulting in numbers formatted like
          *'(%s+%sj)' % (fmt, fmt)*

        - a list of specifiers, one per column - in this case, the real and imaginary
          part must have separate specifiers, e.g. *['%.3e + %.3ej', '(%.15e%+.15ej)']*
          for 2 columns
    delimiter : str, optional
        String or character separating columns.
    newline : str, optional
        String or character separating lines.
    header : str, optional
        String that will be written at the beginning of the file.
    footer : str, optional
        String that will be written at the end of the file.
    comments : str, optional
        String that will be prepended to the ``header`` and ``footer`` strings,
        to mark them as comments. Default: '# ', as expected by e.g. ``numpy.loadtxt``.
    encoding : {None, str}, optional
        Encoding used to encode the outputfile. Does not apply to output streams.
        If the encoding is something other than 'bytes' or 'latin1' you will not be
        able to load the file in NumPy versions < 1.14. Default is 'latin1'.

    Further explanation of the fmt parameter (``%[flag]width[.precision]specifier``):

    **flags:**
        ``-`` : left justify

        ``+`` : Forces to precede result with + or -.

        ``0`` : Left pad the number with zeros instead of space (see width).

    **width:**
        Minimum number of characters to be printed.
        The value is not truncated if it has more characters.

    **precision:**
        - For integer specifiers (eg. ``d,i,o,x``), the minimum number of digits.
        - For ``e, E`` and ``f`` specifiers, the number of digits to print after
          the decimal point.
        - For ``g`` and ``G``, the maximum number of significant digits.
        - For ``s``, the maximum number of characters.

    **specifiers:**
        ``c`` : character

        ``d`` or ``i`` : signed decimal integer

        ``e`` or ``E`` : scientific notation with ``e`` or ``E``.

        ``f`` : decimal floating point

        ``g,G`` : use the shorter of e,E or f

        ``o`` : signed octal

        ``s`` : string of characters

        ``u`` : unsigned decimal integer
