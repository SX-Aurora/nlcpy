def savetxt(fname, X, fmt='%.18e', delimiter=' ', newline='n', header='', footer='',
            comments='# ', encoding=None):
    """Saves an array to a text file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : filename or file handle
        If the filename ends in ``.gz``, the file is automatically saved in compressed
        gzip format. :func:`loadtxt` understands gzipped files transparently.
    x : 1D or 2D array_like
        Data to be saved to a text file.
    fmt : str or sequence of strs, optional
        A single format (%10.5f), a sequence of formats, or a multi-format string, e.g.
        'Iteration %d â€“ %10.5f', in which case *delimiter* is ignored.
        For complex *X*, the legal options for *fmt* are:

        - a single specifier, *fmt='%.4e'*, resulting in numbers formatted like
          *'(%s+%sj)' % (fmt, fmt)*
        - a full string specifying every real and imaginary part,
          e.g. *'%.4e %+.4ej %.4e %+.4ej %.4e %+.4ej'* for 3 columns
        - a list of specifiers, one per column - in this case, the real and imaginary
          part must have separate specifiers, e.g. *['%.3e + %.3ej', '(%.15e%+.15ej)']*
          for 2 columns
    delimiter : str, optional
        String or character separating columns.
    newline : str, optional
        String or character separating lines.
    header : str, optional
        String that will be written at the beginning of the file.
    footer : str, optional
        String that will be written at the end of the file.
    comments : str, optional
        String that will be prepended to the ``header`` and ``footer`` strings,
        to mark them as comments. Default: '# ', as expected by e.g. ``numpy.loadtxt``.
    encoding : {None, str}, optional
        Encoding used to encode the outputfile. Does not apply to output streams.
        If the encoding is something other than 'bytes' or 'latin1' you will not be
        able to load the file in NumPy versions < 1.14. Default is 'latin1'.

    save : Saves an array to a binary file in NumPy ``.npy`` format.
    savez : Saves several arrays into a single file in uncompressed ``.npz`` format.

                       ``.npz`` format.

    Note
    ----
    Further explanation of the fmt parameter (``%[flag]width[.precision]specifier``):

    **flags:**
        ``-`` : left justify

        ``+`` : Forces to precede result with + or -.

        ``0`` : Left pad the number with zeros instead of space (see width).

    **width:**
        Minimum number of characters to be printed.
        The value is not truncated if it has more characters.

    **precision:**
        - For integer specifiers (eg. ``d,i,o,x``), the minimum number of digits.
        - For ``e, E`` and ``f`` specifiers, the number of digits to print after
          the decimal point.
        - For ``g`` and ``G``, the maximum number of significant digits.
        - For ``s``, the maximum number of characters.

    **specifiers:**
        ``c`` : character

        ``d`` or ``i`` : signed decimal integer

        ``e`` or ``E`` : scientific notation with ``e`` or ``E``

        ``f`` : decimal floating point

        ``g,G`` : use the shorter of e,E or f

        ``o`` : signed octal

        ``s`` : string of characters

        ``u`` : unsigned decimal integer

        ``x,X`` : unsigned hexadecimal integer

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import nlcpy as vp
    >>> x = y = z = vp.arange(0.0, 5.0, 1.0)
    >>> vp.savetxt('test.out', x, delimiter=',')   # X is an array
    >>> vp.savetxt('test.out', (x, y, z))   # x,y,z equal sized 1D arrays
    >>> vp.savetxt('test.out', x, fmt='%1.4e')   # use exponential notation
