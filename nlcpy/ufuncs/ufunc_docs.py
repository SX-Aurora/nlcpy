_add_doc = '''
    Computes the element-wise addition of the inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1, x2 : array_like
        The arrays to be added. If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable
        to a common shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
    out : ndarray or None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
        that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated array
        is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have length equal
        to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition is
        True, the *out* array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the *out* array
        will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized *out* array is
        created via the default ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is
        False will remain uninitialized.
    **kwargs
        For other keyword-only arguments, see the section
        :ref:`Optional Keyword Arguments <optional_keyword_arg>`.

    Returns
    -------
    add : ndarray
        The sum of *x1* and *x2*, element-wise. If *x1* and *x2* are both scalars, this
        function returns the result as a 0-dimension ndarray.

    Note
    ----
    Equivalent to `x1` + `x2` in terms of array broadcasting.

    Examples
    --------

        (which becomes the shape of the output).
    out : ndarray or None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
        that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated array

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input an array or a scalar.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray

        function returns the result as a 0-dimension ndarray.

    Note
    ----
    - Logarithm is a multivalued function: for each `x` there is an infinite number of
      `z` such that `exp(z) = x`. The convention is to return the `z` whose imaginary
      part lies in [-pi, pi].
    - For real-valued input data types, :func:`log` always returns real output.
      For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it yields nan
      and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.
    - For complex-valued input, :func:`log` is a complex analytical function that
      has a branch cut [-inf, 0] and is continuous from above on it. :func:`log`
      handles the floating-point negative zero as an infinitesimal negative number,
      conforming to the C99 standard.

    - For real-valued input data types, :func:`arctanh` always returns real
      output. For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it
      returns nan and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.
    - For complex-valued input, :func:`arctanh` is a complex analytical function
      that has branch cuts [-1, -inf] and [1, inf] and is continuous from above on the
      former and from below on the latter.

    Computes the element-wise maximum of the inputs.

    Compare two arrays and returns a new array containing the element-wise maxima.

        For other keyword-only arguments, see the section
        :ref:`Optional Keyword Arguments <optional_keyword_arg>`.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The result of :math:`x1 * 2^{x2}`. If *x1* and *x2* are both scalars, this
        function returns the result as a 0-dimension ndarray.

    Restriction
    -----------
    - *dtype* is a complex dtype : *TypeError* occurs.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import nlcpy as vp
    >>> vp.ldexp(5., vp.arange(4), dtype='float64')
    array([ 5., 10., 20., 40.])

'''
_floor_doc = '''
    Returns the floor of the input, element-wise.

    The floor of the scalar *x* is the largest integer *i*, such that *i* <= *x*.
    It is often denoted as :math:`\\lfloor x \\rfloor`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input arrays or scalars.
    out : ndarray or None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
        that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated array
        is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have length equal
        to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition is
        True, the *out* array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the *out* array
        will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized *out* array is
        created via the default ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is
        False will remain uninitialized.
    **kwargs
        For other keyword-only arguments, see the section
        :ref:`Optional Keyword Arguments <optional_keyword_arg>`.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The floor of each element in *x*. If *x* is a scalar, this function returns the
        result as a 0-dimension ndarray.

    Note
    ----
    Some spreadsheet programs calculate the "floor-towards-zero", in other words
    ``floor(-2.5) == -2``. NLCPy instead uses the definition of :func:`floor` where
    ``floor(-2.5) == -3``.

    array([-2., -2., -1.,  0.,  1.,  1.,  2.])

'''
_ceil_doc = '''
    Returns the ceiling of the input, element-wise.

    The ceiling of the scalar *x* is the smallest integer *i*, such that *i* >= *x*.
    It is often denoted as :math:`\\lceil x \\rceil`.

    Parameters

    x : array_like
        Input arrays or scalars.
    out : ndarray or None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape

    array([-1., -1., -0.,  1.,  2.,  2.,  2.])

'''
_trunc_doc = '''
    Returns the truncated value of the input, element-wise.

    The truncated value of the scalar *x* is the nearest integer *i* which is
    closer to zero than *x* is. In short, the fractional part of the signed number
    *x* is discarded.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input arrays or scalars.
    out : ndarray or None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
        that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated array
        is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have length equal

# matmul
_matmul_doc = '''
    Matrix product of two arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1,x2 : array_like
        Input arrays, scalars not allowed.
    out : ndarray or None,  optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
        that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
        array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
        length equal to the number of outputs.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The matrix product of the inputs. If *x1* and *x2* are both scalars,
        this function returns the result as a 0-dimension array.

    Restriction
    -----------
    - ``x1.ndim > 2`` or ``x2.ndim > 2``: *NotImplementedError* occurs.

    Note
    ----
    The behavior depends on the arguments in the following way.

    - If both arguments are 2-D they are multiplied like conventional matrices.
    - If the first argument is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by prepending a 1 to
      its dimensions. After matrix multiplication the prepended 1 is removed.
    - If the second argument is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by appending a 1 to
      its dimensions. After matrix multiplication the appended 1 is removed.

    See Also
    --------
    dot : Dot product of two arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    For 2-D arrays it is the matrix product:

    >>> import nlcpy as vp
    >>> a = vp.array([[1, 0],[0, 1]])
    >>> b = vp.array([[4, 1],[2, 2]])
    >>> vp.matmul(a, b)
    array([[4, 1],
           [2, 2]])

    For 2-D mixed with 1-D, the result is the usual.

    >>> a = vp.array([[1, 0],[0, 1]])
    >>> b = vp.array([1, 2])
    >>> vp.matmul(a, b)
    array([1, 2])
    >>> vp.matmul(b, a)
    array([1, 2])
